# Generative AI Knowledge Base

## Description
### Tagline
Fine tune an LLM model to answer questions from your documents.

### Detailed
This solution showcases how to extract question & answer pairs out of documents using Generative AI. It provides an end-to-end demonstration of QA extraction and fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) on Vertex AI. Along the way, the solution utilizes Document AI Character Recognition (OCR), Firestore, Vector Search, Vertex AI Studio, and Cloud Functions.

## Architecture
![Knowledge Base using Generative AI](assets/architecture.svg)

- Uploading a new document triggers the webhook Cloud Function.
- Document AI extracts the text from the document file.
- Indexes the document text in Vector Search.
- A Vertex AI Large Language Model generates questions and answers from the document text.
- The questions and answers pairs are saved into Firestore.
- A fine tuning dataset is generated from the Firestore database.
- After human validation, a fine tuned Large Language Model is deployed and saved in the Model Registry.
